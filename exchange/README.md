# NUTC24

This is the NUTC24 project.

General idea is we want to build a robust, fast and reliable exchange with easy to interpret handles. Environment tbd - I was thinking everyone would run on their own process and then we just run all the processes at the same time? But we can work with how that will work. In either case, the actual system will need to be in Cpp.
